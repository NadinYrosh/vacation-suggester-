        <p>Weather can change rapidly during all seasons of the year in Yosemite. Elevation plays a major role in temperature and the amount of precipitation. Most of the moisture comes in the early months of the year; January, February and March.</p>
        <p>Clouds and weather patterns can build up during the summer to produce wonderful thunderstorms, which is another reason why thousands of photographers visit Yosemite National Park every year.</p>
        <p>Throughout the park, you’ll find endless scenic beauty, with opportunities for hiking, biking, horseback riding, and so much more! Dining options include everything from fine-dining at The Majestic Yosemite Hotel to casual, family-friendly options at Half Dome Village. The surrounding areas also include a wide-range of options to enjoy after a long day in the park.</p>
